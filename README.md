I created a video game library application that allows users to view popular games from a third-party API, create their own customizable game library and share games with other users. Users can securely sign in via Google given the application's OAuth authorization framework and share games with each other. Users can add an image, ratings, play duration, genres and notes for each game as well as edit and delete games. When games are shared between users, CRUD operations are limited for users that are "following" the game based on their Google credentials.

Technologies used:
-OAuth
-MongoDB
-Express
-React
-Node
-Javascript
-Tailwind

To install this application, the user would have to npm install the following dependencies:
-react
-react-dom
-react-router-dom
-react-scripts
-web-vitals

User Stories:
My users are gamers who want to track the progress of multiple questlines in games so that if they step away from playing for multiple days, they can resume playing knowing exactly where they left off.

Unsolved problems or future features.
I'd like to incorporate a feature to allow the user to indicate certain games as a "favorite" game.

I created a video game library, connected to an API, that allows users to view games and create their own in a custom game library. Users can add an image, ratings, play duration, genres and notes for each game. Users can also edit and delete these games from the custom games library.


Technologies used:
-MongoDB
-Express
-React
-Node
-Javascript
-Tailwind

To install this application, the user would have to npm install the following dependencies:
-react
-react-dom
-react-router-dom
-react-scripts
-web-vitals

User Stories:
My users are gamers who want to have a collection of games on their phones.

Unsolved problems or future features.
I'd like to incorporate a feature to allow the user to indicate certain games as a "favorite" game.

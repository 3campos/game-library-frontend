I created a video game library, connected to an API, that allowed users to view games and then create a custom game library, allowing the users to add information about the game. Users can add an image and write about ratings, play duration, genres and notes for each game. Users can edit and delete these games as well from the custom games library as well.

Link to your entity relationship diagrams – plan out your data relationships before coding.
This was not required with my issue when I wrote my proposal before coding, so I do not have one. 

Descriptions of any unsolved problems or future features.
I did not reach my stretch goals and I'd like to incorporate a feature to allow the user to favorite games.

A README.md file in your API, if applicable, with a description of what the API is, how to access it, and the endpoints, with a description of how to make requests to each end point and what data to expect back.
I utilized the "RAWG Video Games Database API" to create my API games library. Link to the API instructions manual: https://api.rawg.io/docs/
